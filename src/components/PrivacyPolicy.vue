    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    
    <p>The Game itself does not directly collect personal information such as names, email addresses, or contact details. However, certain data may be collected through third-party services used by the Game, as described below.</p>
    
    <h3>a. Advertising Data</h3>
    
    <p>The Game displays advertisements provided by third-party advertising services. These services may automatically collect certain information to provide and improve ads, including but not limited to:</p>

      <li>Approximate location (derived from IP address)</li>
      <li>Ad interaction data</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This data is collected and processed by the advertising providers in accordance with their own privacy policies. The developer does not have direct access to or control over this data.</p>
    
    <h3>b. Leaderboard Data</h3>
    
    <p>The Game optionally allows players to submit a score to an online leaderboard.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A numerical score value is sent to a backend service to support leaderboard functionality.</li>
      <li>No names, email addresses, or direct personal identifiers are collected by the Game.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The backend service may automatically process limited technical information (such as device or usage data) as necessary to provide this functionality, in accordance with its own privacy practices.</p>
    
    <h2>2. How Information Is Used</h2>
    
    <p>Information collected by third-party services is used for the following purposes:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Displaying advertisements</li>
      <li>Providing optional online leaderboard functionality</li>
      <li>Maintaining and improving service reliability</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    
    <p>The Game uses third-party services to provide advertisements and optional online features such as leaderboards.</p>
    
    <p>These third-party services may collect and process data in accordance with their own privacy policies. Users are encouraged to review those policies for more information on how data is handled.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
    
    <p>The Game does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in relevant jurisdictions). Any data collected by third-party services is subject to their respective child privacy protections and legal obligations.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
